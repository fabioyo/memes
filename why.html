As social networks continue to grow and become central to the propagation of information, it is important to consider the ways memetic content exacerbates and mirrors underlying systems of oppression. It must also be understood, that while memes may shape and influence the way we navigate and view certain issues, they are more likely to be reflective of contemporary culture. We must always remember that our online presence and the content we put out are viewed as commodities by the corporations who can churn a profit from the content we create and share on their social media platforms. They not only have the power to influence what we consume but also have <a href="http://www.gnovisjournal.org/2016/12/09/the-internet-as-a-hegemonic-locus-of-power-on-the-case-of-facebook/"> a stake </a>in keeping certain structures alive. If we social media users are able to understand the algorithms and paths of the content we consume and how social networks deliver and profit from our tweets, likes, posts, and reactions, we may be more mindful of how we <a href="aint.html">contribute to cultural hegemony</a> and further oppressive structures. Understanding these systems is the first step to employ them for the advancement and propagation of progressive ideas, and activists should consider them as valuable tactics. The usage of certain memes, such as <a href="pepe.html">Pepe the Frog</a>, as <img link>hate symbols should be met with active efforts of <a href="http://thephilosophersmeme.com/2016/01/29/the-post-pepe-manifesto/">re-appropriation and subversion</a>, the inverse indicating a success of the adulteration of Pepe the Frog. Activists on the internet should call out, and if appropriate, educate their peers when content relies on the ridicule or mockery of a person because of their marginalized status. Finally, if not already the case, activists should participate in the evolution and creation of memes, but should do so responsibly (link to meme responsibly manifesto), while <a href="http://wagesforfacebook.com/">demanding fair compensation</a> (though not necessarily monetary) and transparency in the way social websites monetize and profit from our presence. It is our duty to meme <a href="manifesto.html">responsibly</a>.
