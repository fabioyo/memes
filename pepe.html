<div class="text"><h3> The memetic response to Pepe the Frog has been quite tumultuous. It can be considered a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-the-frog">classic internet meme</a> in many aspects. Its extreme longevity (in internet years) and the wide variety of mutations contributing to its success are worthy of analysis but my interest is in its recent  re-appropriation by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/opinion/sunday/what-the-alt-right-really-means.html?_r=1">“alt-right”</a> users which has resulted in the meme being classified as a symbol of hate by institutions such as the <a href="http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/pepe-the-frog.html">Anti-Defamation League</a>, signaling a success in the alt-right’s efforts to <a>repurpose the meaning<div  class="disappear"><img src="http://www.jta.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pepenazi.jpg" /></div>
</a> of the meme. This action by the alt-right resembles the act of <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/ccce/polcommcampaigns/CultureJamming.htm">culture jamming</a>, a technique usually used by progressive and anti-consumerist activists. The term has come to signify a specific set of tactics used by these progressive activists, and while groups such as the alt-right use similar tactics to disseminate their ideas, the term is not broad enough to analyze and define these efforts. Therefore I propose using Propaganda Jamming. Rather than exposing the faults in existing hegemonic frameworks (usually corporate) which culture jamming aims to do, propaganda jamming uses similar tactics, i.e. ‘jamming’ of communication networks and subversion of different media to diffuse an ideology. The result being a mass-distribution of content that has been repurposed for political aims, therefore becoming a form of propaganda. It must be noted that the term is not meant to convey an inherently negative or authoritarian meaning, but rather a persuasive process. Since propaganda has historically been a tool to spread different doctrines by agents in power, it could be understood as just another hegemonic strategy, but it is essential to distinguish the tactics used to disseminate these pieces of media from those used by hegemonic actors. The act of propaganda jamming is not confined to a certain section of the political spectrum. For example, it  has  been used as tool by supporters of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/02/23/how-bernie-sanders-became-the-lord-of-dank-memes/?utm_term=.ceafe3709e8a">Bernie Sanders</a> and the rise of Facebook groups which even may contain a richer variety of memes.<br><br>
Pepe the Frog has not been the alt-right’s only propaganda jam but can be considered the face of its efforts. Other tactics include “trolling” online comment boards and more viral strategies such as the spread of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/14/fake-news-donald-trump-election-alt-right-social-media-tech-companies">fake news</a>.  Notable memetic tactics are the editing and re-use of certain politicians’ images, such as  those of <a>President Obama<div  class="disappear"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6WoJ5ZBF6Bg/UIC2WqQPuXI/AAAAAAABB4U/eLU5VRTav7Q/s1600/obama_racist_image1.jpg" /></div>
</a> [this group of content would make up a meme], and the appropriation and remixing of certain presidential candidates’ <a>campaign logos<div  class="disappear"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcJybRmWEAAQX-h.jpg" /></div>
</a>, imagery, and <a>slogans.<div  class="disappear"><img src="https://pics.onsizzle.com/im-with-her-i-am-man-enough-to-vote-for-2774106.png" /></div>
